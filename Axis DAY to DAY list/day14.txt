=>it will be present with in that time(ram)
=>store the data file system
=>stire the data in the form of data base
=>software Data Management system
    =>will help us store the data in h/d 
    =>it will help us to store the data with it's type
    =>arrangment of data in data base will proper so access of data will be easy
    =>all data in the DataBase will be stored in the form of records
    =>when we try access any data from DataBase will return in the form of records

DataBase IN mysql
    =>Collection of data in organized maner
    =>place where all the data are stored
    =>DataBase is Collection of records(tables)
    =>which help us group related table(records) so that when want the data related data we can access it easy
    =>
    command 
        create database database_name 
    list databases in server
        show databases;
    to serch database
        show database like "database name"
            return that database otherwise return empty set

    to delete datadase;
        drop database database_name;

schema
    =>it contains info about your tables in database and there store value info
    =>schema will help your server to underastand your data and help to run server
    =>


tables in database
    =>tables base for database
        =>which will have arrangment of data in form rows and Columns
        =>which help us to structure your data when we try to display the data it will look in proer formate
        =>type od data will be related

        each table will have 
        tables must be uniq
        each table will contain it's attributes(field) with data type

to create any tables in data bases 

        create table table(attributes list);
        create table student(data type name,data type age,data type place,data type dob);

when we try create any table we must include primary key in our table
    primary key is niothing a unic key which help us to identify each records in the table

   id shreram raj primary(1)
   id shreram manu primary(2)

when we use primary key 
    =>we have make primary key as auto increment
    AUTO_INCREMENT 0,1,2,3

Alter the table
    =>field number  int 12 DIGIT
        =>String 1234567='1234567'
    =>firld numbers String
        =>"abc123" => number type

    =>which help us to change the table name or attributes or it's type

command
    Alter table tablename Add new Columns datatype;
    if we want modify the table
        =>Alter table tablename modify column name modifing details;


commands
    =>to ADD column the table
         Alter table tablename ADD columnname datatype after columnname;
    =>to chage old column
        Alter table tablename modify old column name newcolumn name data type;
    =>delete column
        Alter table tablename Drop column columnname;
    =>rename column
        Alter table tablename rename column oldcolumn name newcolumnname;
    =>rename table
        Alter table tablename rename to newtable name

task

to create a relation b/w we have to use foreign relation 
    =>we must have at least one primary in that table which we try to estalish the relation ship
    =>foreign which help us to create foreign relation ship between tables
    =>and each table can have relation ship b/w multiple table
    =>when we try establish foreign relationship we try to refer the that table name allong with it's primary key


Inert records to the table;
    Insert into table_name(filed1,filed2,...) values (value1,value2,value3,....);
    insert into table_name values(value,value2,value3,...); mu records
update table
    after the data in the table
    update table_name set columnname=new value,... where condition;
delete data from tables;
    delete from table_name where condition;
