Topic1 Multithreading concept(thread)
        =>thread
                =>process
                        =>task that is going on
                        =>an excecution state of task called process
                =>thread is an small unit of process(sub-process)
                =>thread dived process into small unit
                =>and each unit will excecute independently
                =>thread will help us to multitsking
        usecase Multithreading
                =>Multithreading will help the user to do multiple task at a time
                =>multiple user can do diffrent becouse each task will work independently
                =>effecy of System will be more
                =>each thread will not affect other thread if some thing wrong in one thread
        =>thread is a lightwight subprocess of given process,thread is a smallest unit of process

        life of thread

        to achive multi threading in java we have a mian class for thread
                that is 
                Thread class
                this class will provid more methods for us to intract with thread

        OS will be beast ex of Multithreading
                =>in os we can do multiple task
                        =>like i can use multiple app at same time
                        =>switch between the task
