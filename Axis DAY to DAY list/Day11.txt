collection frame work
    =>framework
        =>platform ready toll where we can work
        =>it's a collection of class and interfaces which can be developed by some one which avaialabel for you to make your wok easy
        =>Architecture
        =>which is an Architecture for database in java
        =>collection framework will help us to handle you data in effective way
            =>like searching,insert data,etc
        ex:
        UserArray=>[userObj1,userObj2,.....];
        name="surya"
                =>iterate
                userObj1.name==name

        =>collection framework
            =>will contain mainly collection Class and interfaces
                    =>DataBase interfaces(List,Set,Queue,Map)etc
                    =>DataBase Class(ArrayList,Queue,HashMap,LinkedList,stack) etc
                    => iterator interfaces and class
                            =>will help you to traves in the DataBase
                            =>hasNext();
                            =>next();
                            =>remove();
                    =>Any collection class it will hold only group of objects not values

        =>ArrayList
            =>Dynamic Array
            =>size of array is not fixed
            =>ArrayList is an implementaion of List interfaces
            =>ArrayList will maintain orderof insert
            =>ArrayList list will be dynamic size is not fixed

        =>LinkedList
            =>Dynamic Array
            =>Type list
            =>in java pointers is not support
            =>the variable used to hold memory address of another variable pointers
            =>refernce variable
            =>securty
            =>compl,free()=>untacked memory
            =>if any memory entered into untracked Type
            =>garbage collection
            =>free the un refernced memory location
            =>refernce concept
            
        =>linked list
            node=>node1=>node2....
            node   [address,data]
            =>node objects
                    =>multiple different type value
                    =>data
                    =>next node like
       doubly linked=>pri node like
            =>refernce
        =>allways linked list hold the objects

        =>to create linked list in java
            LinkedList class it's an implementaion of list 

TASK1
    =>implementaion of stack using LinkedList of collection frame work


    Set 
    =>each elements in list must be uniqe
    =>Hashset class maintain implementaion of set interfaces

   TASK2 understand Queue in collection

    Map(interfaces)
        =>key and value pair
        =>map it's type dataStructure in java wehre each value in list hold two value(key and values)
        =>in map key must be unique

    =>HashMap(class) implementaion of that interfaces
        =>
    task on hash map
        =>create class student
            =>name
            =>rollno
            =>collage
            =>place
            =>branch
            =>some
            
        class helperClass
           HashMap<String,Student> StudentMap//store all student object inside this map
            =>addStudent()
                =>this help you to create student object take student details add that student object inside HashMap
                using student rollno as key
            =>serchStudet()
                take student rollno as key using search is student is present in map if there print student details
            =>deletestudent()
                take rollno and delete student
        main(){
            while(true){
                switch(case){
                    case 1:addStudent()
                    case 2:serach();
                    case 3 :deletestudent();
                    case 4:exit();
                }
            }
        }
