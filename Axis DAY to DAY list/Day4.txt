                                    JAVA
java community very high
    => java have library
    => 

java programing langauge , it's an obejct-oriented,secured ,class-based programing langauge

    =>java is platform (code once run any platform)
    =>bytecode approch
    =>java is developed by james golsing 1995-96
    =>1970-1980
    =>oak first name java
    =>java 
    =>1996 oracle

java 
    obejct-oriented langauge
    =>object will says dont take data as just value,activity

APPLICATION
    =>standalone APPLICATION
        =>single pack for software
        =>old
        => it's an software which need to install for all machine
    =>Enterprise APPLICATION
        =>large software
        =>APPLICATION distribute in nature
        => Bank APPLICATION
            =>axis bank APPLICATION 
            => use of APPLICATION will be done at diffrent location
    =>web APPLICATION
        =>APPLICATION which run on serve side which can have multiple dynamic web page
    =>Mobile APPLICATION
        =>java used to develop Mobile APPLICATION 

java diffrent types(edition)
    java SE(Standard edition)
        =>API developer math log .. file

JAVA 1995
JDK 1995(JDK1.0)1996
    =>march java version
    java 18(2022)
    java 19(2023)
    =>september

features of java
    =>obejct-oriented
    =>secured
    =>robust
    =>platform independent
    =>portable(bytecode)
    =>Architecture neutral(32,64)
        => it will not depend on implemetation level of os
    
build of java
        JVM =>java virtual machine
            =>it povide environment to excecute java(run time environment)
                =>java normal langauge like (english) => machine langauge
                => java to=> byte code => machine code 
            => auto memory managment
            =>complining and interpret the java code
            =>convert bytecode to machine code
            => verfiy your code
            =>load the code
            => excecute the code   (runtime environment)
        JRE =>(java runtime environment)
            => it will contains jvm library
            => implemetation of jvm
            => it exit physically
        JDK => (Java DEVELOPMENT KIT)
            =>JRE+DEVELOPMENT tools
            => ALL TOOLS THAT required to develop a java
            => develop use this to develop an APPLICATION
            => library

variable
statements
    =>condition looping
function(methods)
object
class

variable
    =>place used store values
    =>names memory location
    =>identifers which poin to memory location
    =>it's a container which holds data
    =>variable name of memory location where my value is storing
        =>primitive variable(normal variable)

        =>non primitive variable(reference variable)
            the variable which hold addres of another memory location(the variable which store non primitive data)


memory managment 
    => memory divide into two parts
        =>stack and heap
            =>stack all primitive data type value storing 
            => address of memory location stored in variable name='s'
            => all variable hold only the address of stack memory
            => when you any any non primitive data type which stored inside heap
             names[098ghsfdhgs]="surya"


          stack=>  [5][][].......[5].......[089tyghjlvn]
                                            098ghsfdhgs
            068htlkfged
          heap=> ....[][][].....[surya]......
                               089tyghjlvn
    Data type
        =>primitive data type
            =>main data type are =>int[4 byte ],float[4byte],char[2byte],double[8byte],byte(1byte),long(8byte),boolean,short(2byte) 
        =>non primitive data type
            =>data type the is created(derived) using primitive data type is called string,Array,obejct class
        =>int float char double string byte long boolean array short 

        =>binary values 
            32bit (0101010101010101010101010..) 1
                              

             10=>      00000000..1010
                          8+2=10 
                          

                1=>       00000001


unicode system
    =>it's  a process of convert char into specific number system
    => A => 65 => binary
        =>ASCII c,c++,size of code convertion not limit 16byte => unicode
        =>KOI =>china rusian =>
        =>
    =>2byte of value

operators
    =>Arithmetic
        =>+,-,*,/,% 
    =>logical
        =>&&(both condition true=>true),||(any one of the condition is true),!(true=>flase)
        combine diffrent condition

    =>bitwise
