Collection framework
    =>Array
        =>Collection of similar type of data
        =>size fixed
        =>contiguous memory location
        =>in java Array will consider as object
        =>Array will defined with data follwed by some method
        =>size fixed
        Syntax of Array
        //datatype Arrayname[sizeof Array];
        datatype Arrayname[]=new datatype[size of Array];
        store and retrive elements in Array we use index
        array we used send grouph of data from method to another
        Anonymous array
            =>array without name
    =>for each loop
        =>foreach loop we can use to get each elements in array

        Array 10
        array[11]=45;
            if you try to access array elements not with in the range you will get the exception called array out of bound exception

            for copy array elements
                =>clone
                =>system.arrayCopy()
            =>mutidimention array
                =>int array[][]=new int[5][6];
            =>get length of array
            =>Arrayname.length;

    =>string
        =>sequence of char
        =>it's array with char type
        String str="java"; 
        //String str=new String("java");

    char[] string=new char[10];


task1
    =>you have to create a class Student
            =>name
            =>age
            =>place
            =>collage
            arrayStudent[];
            count;
            maibn(){
                while(){
                    switch(){
                        case1 :addStudent();
                        case 2:displaystudent();
                        case 3:exit();
                    }
                }
            }

        addstudent()

            take values
            after you create the object
            you need to store all objects inside this class array
            [student objects]
        displaystudent()
            display student details using that index of array and that perticular object

Exception Handling
    =>                               type error
    Syntax error(compile time error)                    runtime error()

    it's a process of handle errors at run time
        =>to makesure that over normal flow code will be statified
        to handle 
        to handle exception we use two blocks
            try and catch blocks
            throw block used for exception Handling
            throws keyword

                           Exception type
        checked Exception                                  unchecked exception
     the exception will be checked at compile time   Exception that accour at execution time
     IOException                                                

     try
     catch
    unchecked exception
        =>Nullpoint exception
            Student std=null;
            std.name;
            if try to access any property of null object
        =>Arithmetic Exception
            =>/ by zero
            =>run time in Arithmetic operation +,-,*,/,%
        =>indexoutOFbound exception
            =>Arrayindexoutofbound exception
            =>stringindexoutofbound exception
                =>if try to access the elements of array or string behind it's range
                =>[0,10] [11] [-1]
        =>NumberFormat exception
            =>12x to float
            =>typemismatch exception
        =>Connection exception
            =>data base
            =>sql data Connection ex
        =>file Exception
            =>buffer exception
    
    Try Exception

    for lazy exception handling
        we use throw

    Your logic must be included in try block
    All exception handling must be included in catch block
