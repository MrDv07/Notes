Polymorphism
    =>multiple form
    =>method Overloading
        =>method with same name but differnt in parameters;
        print()
        System.out.print()
            =>print()
    =>method Overloading
        it can be implement by 3 ways
            =>by change the parameters numbers
            =>by change type of parameters
            =>return type //not support for new version ambiguity error
    Overloading can be used for any methods
        =>main method
        =>user defined method
        =>constructor

    method overriding
        =>same method will present differnt class while you inherit the classes
        =>if you want to call parent method use super.method_name
        =>all child method will execute first if that is not there then it go for parent
        =>child method will have highest priority than parent

Encapsulation
    =>data hiding
    =>it's a process of hiding the implemetation 
    =>data  binding
    => data hiding

Abstraction
    =>hiding implemetation
    =>it's a process of hiding the implemetation
    Abstract class
        =>class which contain some Abstract method
        =>Abstract method
            =>a method which is define but there is no implemetation of that method
            =>we use abstract class when we dont' know some implemetation and we know some other implemetation
